# Release notes

I've created this bot out of pure curiosity on how to create something to use on the terminal/powershell. 
I don't have backend experience, so I've used ChatGPT to create a financial chat bot, for anyone to use and receive tips on financial literacy.


## How to install

Run `brew install financial-chatbot` in your terminal.

## How to use

You'll receive the instructions after.
